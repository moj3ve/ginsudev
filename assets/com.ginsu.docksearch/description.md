_Search the web from your Home Screen._  

This tweak adds a search bar to the dock on the Home Screen, which can be used to search the web, access websites and so on. DockSearch also works perfectly with the user's default browser choice, such as Chrome or Edge.  

**Does not support iPad or floating docks (For now).**
