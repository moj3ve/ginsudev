Give your notch some purpose! NotchBanners transforms the appearance of notification banners by making them drop down below the notch, as if they were part of the notch itself.  

**Features:**

*   A banner design that integrates with the device's notch.
*   Custom colour support
*   More coming..

This tweak should also support non-notched devices, although they don't have a notch. :)  

**iOS 14+**
