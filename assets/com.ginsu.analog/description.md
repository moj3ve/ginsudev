_A theme able analog clock for your Lock Screen!_  

**Supports iOS 14+ (iPhone and iPad)**  

If you prefer classy analog clocks and are bored of iOS's default digital clock, then Analog for you! Analog adds a fully customisable analog clock to the Lock Screen with the following features:

*   Clock face and clock hand theming (Themers can design their own clock themes and put them up for download somewhere).
*   Customisable date complication.
*   A lock status indicator for devices with Face-ID.
*   A digital time complication.
*   Wallpaper colour detection.
*   Supports translations.
*   And many more customisable options!

### For Theme creators:

**Custom clock faces:**  

Custom clock faces should be 500x500px ".png" files named "Face.png". You should make a folder with the name of your theme, then place your "Face.png" inside. You can then place the folder you created in this directory "/Library/Application Support/Analog/Faces/".  

**Custom clock hands:**  

There is 4 main images needed to create a set of clock hands: "Center.png, Seconds.png, Hour.png, Minute.png". The dimensions for the files are as follows:

*   Center.png = 25x25px
*   Seconds.png = 16x120px
*   Hour.png = 16x101px
*   Minute.png = 16x120px

Similarly to custom clock faces, you need to create a folder with the name of your theme, then place those images inside the folder. After that, you can place the folder in the directory: "/Library/Application Support/Analog/Hands/".
