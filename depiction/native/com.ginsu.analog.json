Analog adds a fully customisable analog clock to the Lock Screen with the following features:\n\n*   Clock face and clock hand theming (Themers can design their own clock themes and put them up for download somewhere).\n*   Customisable date complication.\n*   A lock status indicator for devices with Face-ID.\n*   A digital time complication.\n*   Wallpaper colour detection.\n*   Supports translations.\n*   And many more customisable options!\n\n### For Theme creators:\n\n**Custom clock faces:**  \n\nCustom clock faces should be 500x500px \".png\" files named \"Face.png\". You should make a folder with the name of your theme, then place your \"Face.png\" inside. You can then place the folder you created in this directory \"/Library/Application Support/Analog/Faces/\".  \n\n**Custom clock hands:**  \n\nThere is 4 main images needed to create a set of clock hands: \"Center.png, Seconds.png, Hour.png, Minute.png\". The dimensions for the files are as follows:\n\n*   Center.png = 25x25px\n*   Seconds.png = 16x120px\n*   Hour.png = 16x101px\n*   Minute.png = 16x120px\n\nSimilarly to custom clock faces, you need to create a folder with the name of your theme, then place those images inside the folder. After that, you can place the folder in the directory: \"/Library/Application Support/Analog/Hands/\".\n","useSpacing":"true","class":"DepictionMarkdownView"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionHeaderView","title":"Information"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Developer","text":"Ginsu"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Version","text":"1.1"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Compatibility","text":"iOS 14.0 to 15.9"},{"class":"DepictionTableTextView","title":"Section","text":"Tweaks"},{"class":"DepictionSpacerView"},{"class":"DepictionTableButtonView","title":"Contact Support","action":"depiction-https://repo.ginsu.dev/depiction/native/help/com.ginsu.analog.json","openExternal":"true","tintColor":"#55c6d3"},{"class":"DepictionLabelView","text":"Ginsu Tweaks | Silica 1.2.2","textColor":"#999999","fontSize":"10.0","alignment":1}],"class":"DepictionStackView"},{"tabname":"Changelog","views":[{"class":"DepictionMarkdownView","markdown":"#### Version 1.1\n\n- Transitioned to libgscommon to handle most preference-related stuff for better maintenance."},{"class":"DepictionLabelView","text":"Ginsu Tweaks | Silica 1.2.2","textColor":"#999999","fontSize":"10.0","alignment":1}],"class":"DepictionStackView"}],"class":"DepictionTabView"}
